Hi world!

My name is Shay Chestnut. I'm from Payson, Utah. Well, I grew up in Elberta, Utah, but people question its existence because it's so tiny so saying I'm from Payson is much easier. I like movies a lot, especially old movies, B movies, and TV shows like Game of Thrones, although I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I watch that one. I like other things, too, like traveling and thrifting. That's me.

Shay




Bye world!
